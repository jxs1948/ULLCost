# ULLCost

This is an ASP.Net MVC applicadtion that is developed mainly for new students to find various links for information required to join the university and significantly to estimate the tuition and fees for each student depending on the input provided such as for instance "A student is internation, non-resident trying to know the tuition and fees for 9 credits in spring 2018" 
So by choosing the values in a dropdown box for the question asked the student can access to the fees that are saved in the database of the application.

Database used : SQLite 
Application development uses DB browser to overview the values stored in the database.
